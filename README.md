# Innocuous

You can change what it says by creating a file named speak.xml in the folder the executable is in, then add this into the file

    <Speech say="soi" windowCount="100" windowWait="250" />

Change soi to whatever you want and it will say that on program execution, change the number at windowCount to whatever number and that is how many windows it will open, change the number at windowWait and that is how many milliseconds it will wait before opening a window
